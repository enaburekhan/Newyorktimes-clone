              <p>
                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and a
                year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
                world
                of known physics.
              </p>
              <p>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the
                Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
                in the
                presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
                repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant.
              </p>
              <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                pole and
                not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities.
                Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
              </p>
              <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
              </p>
              <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the Big
                Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
              </p>
              <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
                Pole, a
                team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
                ripples in
                the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
                violently
                apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
                long-sought
                smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
              whether it
              could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
              of dark
              energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space
              and
              energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
              its
              hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
              architecture and
              fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
              bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
            <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
              reach of
              particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be
              the first
              direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
              should
              ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
              said, “This
              is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
              gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
              permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
              surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
              Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
              Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

        <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
        <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded
          so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
        <figure class="inflation">
          <img class="inflation-img" src="images/inflation-945.png" alt="">
        </figure>
        <figure class="fig1"><strong>THE UNIVERSE </strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the
          Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a
          mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature</figure>
        <figure class="fig2"> NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast
          distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches
          of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.</figure>
        <figure class="fig3">DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
          direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much
          it has cooled</figure>
        <figure class="fig5">COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
          coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every
          direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</figure>
        <figure class="fig5">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to
          place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at
          the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</figure>
        <figure class="fig6">INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second
          after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently
          expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</figure>
        <figure class="fig7">FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls
          of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe.
          These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</figure>
        <figure class="fig8">EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than
          light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of
          the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</figure>

        <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
        <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation
          in his lifetime.</p>
        <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”

          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing
          email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
          Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
          that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
        <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
          known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo,
          a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell
          him the news.</p>

        <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything</p>
        <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
          ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an
          email.</p>
        <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news
          like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
        <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
          astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
        <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as
          one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.</p>
        <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the
          South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
          convincing,” he said.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
          universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
          expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
        <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new
          results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
          Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
        <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said</p>
        <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At
          least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>
        <h4>Spirals in the Sky</h4>

        <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
          accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p> 

        <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep,
          which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry
          air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock
          of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
